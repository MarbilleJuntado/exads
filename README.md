# Exads

*Algorithms and Data Structures Collection in Elixir*

This is a library with a collection of some of the most used and well known
algorithms and data structures. 

Find the algorithms inside Exads.Algos and data structures inside 
Exads.DataStructures

## Installation

  1. Add exads to your list of dependencies in mix.exs:

        def deps do
          [{:exads, "~> 0.0.1"}]
        end

  2. Ensure exads is started before your application:

        def application do
          [applications: [:exads]]
        end
